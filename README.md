## About
These programs work together to copy network traffic and back them up to a remote server. They are intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi posing as an open wireless access point.

This project was part of work done for a university security course. It is intended for **learning and research purposes**. Don't use these programs on other people without getting **informed consent**. It's not very nice and depending on where you live it could be illegal.
